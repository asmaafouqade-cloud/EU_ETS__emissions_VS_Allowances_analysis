EU ETS Emissions vs Carbon Price: Did Higher EUA Prices Drive Emissions Reductions?
Research questions

How did emissions and emissions reductions trends differ across EU ETS covered sectors ?
Are reductions driven by allowances prices ?

Key findings

Power and industry are the dominant emitting sectors throughout, while aviation and other minor sectors contribute relatively low or near-zero emissions.
Emissions decline is driven primarily by the power sector, whose emissions fall by nearly half between 2005 and 2023, whereas industry emissions fluctuate but remain broadly stable over the period.
Year-to-year emissions changes are mostly positive between 2005 and 2012, particularly in the power sector, followed by sharp and sustained declines from 2013 onward across all sectors.
EUA prices remain low and volatile until 2019 and increase sharply only after 2020, meaning that the main emission reductions precede the sustained price increase, indicating no clear contemporaneous correlation between emissions changes and EUA price levels.
